# X Education Lead Scoring Case Study

## Objective
The objective of this case study is to build a logistic regression model to assign lead scores to potential leads, helping the company identify the most promising leads with a higher chance of conversion.

## Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider, faces challenges with a low lead conversion rate. The company aims to improve efficiency by focusing on potential leads likely to convert. The goal is to build a predictive model that assigns lead scores, allowing the sales team to prioritize high-scoring leads.

## Goals
1. Develop a logistic regression model to assign lead scores (0 to 100) based on conversion likelihood.
2. Address additional challenges provided by the company for future model adjustments.
3. Include recommendations and insights in a final presentation.

## Solution Approach
1. **Data Loading:** Load the dataset containing information on leads and conversion outcomes.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explore data to understand lead characteristics and patterns.
3. **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and prepare data for modeling.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transformations to enhance model performance.
5. **Outlier Analysis:** Identify and handle outliers that may impact model accuracy.
6. **Model Building:** Implement logistic regression to predict lead scores.
7. **Model Performance Benchmarking:** Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model parameters through cross-validation.
9. **Model Diagnosis:** Examine probability calibration, ROC AUC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve.
10. **Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights for lead nurturing and conversion optimization.

## Expected Outcome
The logistic regression model will enable X Education to prioritize potential leads effectively, ultimately improving the lead conversion rate.

## Next Steps
1. Continuous Monitoring: Regularly monitor the model's performance and update as needed.
2. Feedback Integration: Incorporate feedback from the sales team to enhance model accuracy.
3. Advanced Techniques: Explore advanced machine learning methods for improved predictions.
4. Personalization: Implement personalized communication strategies based on lead segments.
5. Compliance: Ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations.
6. Customer Satisfaction: Integrate customer satisfaction feedback into model refinement.

By following this approach, X Education can streamline its lead conversion process and achieve higher conversion rates.
